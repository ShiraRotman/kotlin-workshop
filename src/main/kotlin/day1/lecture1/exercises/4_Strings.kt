/**
 *
 * BMI calculator!
 *
 * Body mass index (BMI) is a value derived from the mass (weight) and height of a person.
 * The BMI is defined as the body mass divided by the square of the body height,
 * and is universally expressed in units of kg/(m^2),
 * resulting from mass in kilograms and height in metres.
 *
 * Calculate my cat's BMI.
 * He wieghts 5.2 kg, and about 48 cm long (which is 0.48 metter's)
 *
 * Create two variables for my cat's weight (mass) in kg, and length (m).
 *
 * Use a String template to print my cat's BMI. [mass / (length.pow(2))]
 *
 * BONUS: compare my cat to a 2 year old girl:
 * underwight - 	BMI equalse or below 15.5
 * normal weight - 	BMI between 15.5 to 17.5
 * overwight - 		BMI equalse or above 17.5
 * add to the string template weather my cat is underweight, normal weight or overweight.
