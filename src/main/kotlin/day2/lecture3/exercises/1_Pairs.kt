/**
 * Let's go through an example of getting information about a book in the format of a Pair.
 * Generally, you want information about both the title and the author, and perhaps also the year.
 *
 * Let’s create a basic book class, with a title, author, and year.
 * Of course, you could get each of the properties separately.
 *
 * Create a method that returns both the title and the author as a Pair.
 * Create a method that returns the title, author and year as a Triple.
 *
 * Use the documentation to find out how to use Triple.
 *
 * Create a book instance.
 *
 * Print out the information about the book in a sentence,
 * such as: “Here is your book X written by Y in Z.”
 *
